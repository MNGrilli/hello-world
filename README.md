# hello-world

Hello GitHub community!

My name is Marco and i'm a beginner in this platform (and also in the IT world...)
Right now i'm following GitHub's "Hello-World" guide, i hope that i'll be soon able to contriubute in other projects,
as well as i'll be creting my own's. 
And... Please don't mind my english, which is terrible right now, i hope that i can improve it ASAP.
